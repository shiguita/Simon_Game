# Simple Simon Game project

For the (Course)[https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/] I'm currently learning one of the projects was recreating the Simon Game in HTML, CSS and JS. I tried my best in recreating the game as close as possible to the physical one. I based my code on the solution given by one of the (students in the comments)[https://codepen.io/alphaplusplus/pen/MWoXzVa].

I don't like the design all that much and there are quite a few inefficiencies in the code. I decided to implement a class for the game algorithm to try out classes in JS.
